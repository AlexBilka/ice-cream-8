      In the small Italian town of Ruvo di Puglia, siblings Giuliana and
      Vincenzo Paparella carry on a 180-year-old family tradition making gelato
      from only three ingredients: milk, sugar, and eggs. It all started in 1840
      when Uncle Luigi brought the art of gelato making from the royal courts of
      Naples to his hometown, Ruvo, and gave it a home. Fast-forward four
      generations, and the original 1840 recipe, the King's Cream, has been
      joined by seven other flavors: pistachio, almond, chocolate, quince,
      nougat, gianduia, and hazelnut. Behind each and every one of them, the two
      siblings will transform every ingredient but sugar, from crushing cocoa
      beans to sourcing vanilla pods from Mexico. We follow Giuliana while she
      shows us the preparation behind the almond flavor.
