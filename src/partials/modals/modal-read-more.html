        In the small Italian town of Ruvo di Puglia, siblings Giuliana and
        Vincenzo Paparella carry on a 180-year-old family tradition making gelato
        from only three ingredients: milk, sugar, and eggs. It all started in 1840
        when Uncle Luigi brought the art of gelato making from the royal courts of
        Naples to his hometown, Ruvo, and gave it a home. Fast-forward four
        generations, and the original 1840 recipe, the King's Cream, has been
        joined by seven other flavors: pistachio, chocolate, quince, nougat,
        gianduia, and hazelnut. Behind each and every one of them, the two
        siblings will transform every ingredient but sugar, from crushing cocoa
        beans to sourcing vanilla pods from Mexico.
